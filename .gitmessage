# <type>: <specific description of what changed>
#
# AVOID generic messages like:
# ❌ "Implement feature X to enhance user experience"
# ❌ "Fix bug Y in module Z"
# ❌ "Update code to improve functionality"
#
# USE specific, actionable descriptions:
# ✅ "feat: add Hue bridge auto-discovery via mDNS"
# ✅ "fix: handle missing device response in HueV2Engine"
# ✅ "refactor: extract authentication logic to separate method"
#
# Type can be:
#   feat:     A new feature (add X, implement Y)
#   fix:      A bug fix (resolve X, handle Y, prevent Z)
#   docs:     Documentation only changes
#   style:    Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
#   refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#   perf:     A code change that improves performance
#   test:     Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
#   chore:    Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
#
# Project-specific examples for HueV2:
#   feat: add dimmer support for Hue bulbs
#   feat: implement scene activation via QuickApp
#   fix: resolve bridge connection timeout after 30s
#   fix: handle missing light state in device sync
#   refactor: simplify HueV2Engine device initialization
#   perf: cache device states to reduce API calls
#   docs: add installation guide for Hue bridge setup
#
# Guidelines:
# - Be specific about WHAT changed, not WHY
# - Use present tense ("add" not "added")
# - Include relevant component names (HueV2Engine, bridge, etc.)
# - Mention specific functions/methods when relevant
# - Keep under 50 characters for the subject line
